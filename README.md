# Project - Bubble Sort

## The Odin Project Assignment

### Task Scenario

#### From Wikipedia:

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. 

## My implementation

I have Implemented a method `#bubble_sort` that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It use the bubble sort methodology.
I have also created a similar method called `#bubble_sort_by` which sorts an array but accepts a block. The block take two arguments which represent the two elements currently being compared.
